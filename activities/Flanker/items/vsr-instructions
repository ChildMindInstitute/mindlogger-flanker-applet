      In this task, you will see arrows presented at the center of the screen that point either to the left ![arrowleft.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtg137/Flanker_applet/master/images/arrow-left.png) or right ![arrowRight.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtg137/Flanker_applet/master/images/arrow-right.png).
      Your job is to respond by pressing the left button if the arrow is pointing to the left ![arrowleft.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtg137/Flanker_applet/master/images/arrow-left.png) or by pressing the right button if the arrow is pointing to the right ![arrowRight.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtg137/Flanker_applet/master/images/arrow-right.png).
      The arrows that you respond to will always be presented in the center of the screen.
      These arrows will appear in the middle of a line of other items, with other items on either side of the central arrow.
      Sometimes, these items will also be arrows pointing in the same direction, e.g.. ![congruentRight.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtg137/Flanker_applet/master/images/congruent-right.png), or in the opposite direction, e.g. ![incongruentRight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtg137/Flanker_applet/master/images/incongruent-right.png).
      No matter what direction the arrows on either side of the central arrow are pointing, your job is to respond to the central arrow.
      If you see ![congruent-left](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtg137/Flanker_applet/master/images/congruent-left.png), you would press the left button because the middle arrow is pointing to the left.
      If you see ![incongruent-left](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtg137/Flanker_applet/master/images/incongruent-left.png) you would also press the left button because the middle arrow is pointing to the left. Finally, in some trials the central arrow will have dashes ‘ - ’ to either side of the central arrow. Again, your job is to respond to the direction of the central arrow, and ignore the dashes, just as you would the arrows.
      You only respond to the direction of the central arrow.
      Please respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
