    "en": "## General Instructions\n\n\n You will see arrows presented at the center of the screen that point either to the left ‘<’ or right ‘>’.\n Press the left button if the arrow is pointing to the left ‘<’ or press the right button if the arrow is pointing to the right ‘>’.\n These arrows will appear in the center of a line of other items. Sometimes, these other items will be arrows pointing in the same direction, e.g.. ‘> > > > >’, or in the opposite direction, e.g. ‘< < > < <’.\n Your job is to respond to the central arrow, no matter what direction the other arrows are pointing.\n For example, you would press the left button for both ‘< < < < <’, and ‘> > < > >’ because the middle arrow points to the left.\n Finally, in some trials dashes ‘ - ’ will appear beside the central arrow.\n\n Again, respond only to the direction of the central arrow. Please respond as quickly and accurately as possible."
